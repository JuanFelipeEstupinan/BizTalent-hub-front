# BizTalent Hub

This project is a job board application built with **Vite**, **React** and **TypeScript**. It provides a starting point for building a platform where businesses can post jobs, search and manage candidates, and handle payments.

## Features

- Multiâ€‘step wizard for creating job postings
- Candidate search and management interface
- Stripe payment integration
- WhatsApp or Email contact links for candidates

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application is served at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

This repo was bootstrapped from the standard Vite + React template and extended with an initial project structure to support the features above.
